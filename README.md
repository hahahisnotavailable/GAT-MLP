# GAT-MLP
The GAT-MLP combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structure encoding and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling, and is used for algorithm selection in solving the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP).
This code is associated with our paper, titled "Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP". For further details, you can refer to the full paper available on arXiv:

More complete code and datasets will be made available after they are organized and finalized.
