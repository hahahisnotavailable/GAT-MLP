# GAT-MLP
The **GAT-MLP** model combines the Graph Attention Network (GAT) for local structure encoding and the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for global feature modeling. It is specifically designed for algorithm selection in solving the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP).  
This code is associated with our paper, titled:  
> **"Learning to Select MCP Algorithms: From Traditional ML to Dual-Channel GAT-MLP"**.  
For further details, you can refer to the full paper available on arXiv:

More complete code and datasets will be made available once they are organized and finalized.
